Create a new django project and create the 3 html files inside it for home page, login and signup.

intergrated with the OpenCV

note: we need use the image file as filename only not the link
so we need to download them into our prject

What is opencv?
-> open source computer vision
-> used mainly for image processing and computer vision

Steps:

1. we need to install the opencv in our project
   pip install opencv-python

2. create a sample.py file and import cv2 package
<!-- 3. write a code print(cv2.__version__) -->

Predefined functions available:

1. how to read an image to our program
   -> imread()
   -> used to get the image from the specified location
   syntax:
   <!-- cv2.imread(filename,flag) -->

   filename = the path to the image. it shouldn't be a direct link
   <!-- flag = how the image should be read(with color or without color) -->

   if you want the image in color, we need to give that as cv2.IMREAD_COLOR
   if you want the image in grayscale, we need to give that as cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE

   we need to store this image in a variable

2. how we need to display the image
   -> imshow()
   -> used to display the image as a dialogue box

   syntax:
   cv2.imshow(window_name,image_variable)

3. To keep the image output steady.
   -> waitKey()
   -> used to hold the output window for certain seconds until user enter/press any key
   syntax:
   cv2.waitKey(0)

4. how to close the output window without using close icon
   ->destoryAllWindows()
   -> used to close all the output windows
   syntax:
   cv2.destoryAllWindows()
5. How to get multiple image loaded to multiple output screen

import cv2

img1 = cv2.imread("blood cell.jpg",cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
img2 = cv2.imread("blood cell.jpg",cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

cv2.imshow("Input Image1",img1)
cv2.imshow("Input image2",img2)

cv2.waitKey(0)

cv2.destroyAllWindows()

6.  How to get multiple image loaded to single output window
    -> concatenate()
    -> this concatenate function is available only in out numpy package not in opencv package
    -> image needs to be same as input don't change the color frames.
    syntax:
    numpy.concatenate((filenames...),axis=val)

    val = 0 or 1
    0 -> combine the files into vertical axis
    1 -> combine the files into horizontal axis

    1.  we need to import the numpy package
        import numpy
        <!--  Install Numpy (if not already installed):
              Open the VS Code terminal (View > Terminal) and run:
              pip install numpy -->
              used to have lot of advance mathematical formulas, implementation, inside that package with predefined executions

import cv2
import numpy

img1 = cv2.imread("blood cell.jpg")
img2 = cv2.imread("blood cell.jpg")

img = numpy.concatenate((img1,img2),axis=1)

cv2.imshow("Concatenated Images",img)

cv2.waitKey(0)

cv2.destroyAllWindows()

7 how to save an image using opencv
-> cv2.imwrite()
-> used to store the converted image or the output for future purpose 7. How to save an image using opencv
-> imwrite()
-> used to store the images used in our project with different names for future purpose.

    syntax:
    cv2.imwrite(imagename,image_source)

import cv2

img = cv2.imread('blood cell.jpg',cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

imagename = 'grayscale_converted_image.jpg'

cv2.imwrite(imagename,img)

# img = cv2.imread('grayscale_converted_image.jpg')

# cv2.imshow('output',img)

cv2.waitKey(0)

cv2.destroyAllWindows()

8.  How to resize the images which we read.
    -> most of the time, we will not get the perfect size of the image, sometimes it will be large or too small. So, we need to
    re-size the image to common size.
    -> resize()
    -> used to re-size the images to a common size.
    syntax:
    cv2.resize(source,dsize,destination,fx,fy,interpolation)

        source -> image which we have read
        dsize -> size of the output iamge
        destination -> the output image to be saved once again (work like imwrite())
                    -> optional
        fx - scale factor on horizontal axis
        fy - scale factor on vertical axis
        interpolation - automated sizing
            -> INTER_AREA
                -> when we are going to use a image as shrinked one
            -> INTER_CUBIC
                -> slowest resizing option
            -> INTER_LINEAR
                -> when we are going to use a image as zoomed one
            -> optional

        1. half image condition
            -> dsize = (0,0)
            -> fx > 0
            -> fy > 0

    import cv2
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

img = cv2.imread('blood cell.jpg')
cv2.imshow('Normal Output',img)

cv2.resize(source,dsize,destination,fx,fy,interpolation)
half_image = cv2.resize(img,(0,0),fx=0.5,fy=0.5)
large_image = cv2.resize(img,(700,350))
shrinking = cv2.resize(img,(750,400),interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)

cv2.imshow("shrinking",shrinking)

cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

---

import cv2

img = cv2.imread('blood cell.jpg')

# edge1 = cv2.Canny(img,0,300)

# edge2 = cv2.Canny(img,100,300)

# edge3 = cv2.Canny(img,200,300)

edge4 = cv2.Canny(img,0,1000)

# cv2.imshow("Edge1 Output",edge1)

# cv2.imshow("Edge2 Output",edge2)

# cv2.imshow("Edge3 Output",edge3)

cv2.imshow("Edge4 Output",edge4)

cv2.waitKey(0)

cv2.destroyAllWindows()

9.  Edge detection

    -> is a process that involves detecting sharp edges in the image.

    -> canny() function

        -> canny edge detection algorithm

            -> John F. Canny

    -> use of this algorithm:

        -> Noise reduction using filters

        -> maximum supression (we need to have only the shapes of the images)

    syntax:

    cv2.Canny(source,min value, max value, size,L2gradient)

        source = image

        minvalue = minimum gradient

        maxvalue = maximum gradient

        size = optional

        L2gradient = used to provide the accurate gradient calculation

                  -> two values possible

                  ->0 -> false

                  ->1 -> true

    min = 0 -> with inner circle and all possible edges of the images

    min = 100 -> with few inner circles are possible

For converting from color to grayscale
-> cvtColor()
-> used to convert the given image into any color for image as you wish
-> grayscale = cv2.COLOR_BGR3GRAY
For blurring the images
-> GaussianBlur()
syntax:
cv2.GaussianBlur(image,(sigmaX,sigmaY),kernal_size)
For the theshold image
-> threshold()
for the contour image
-> whether we have curved edges in our given image
-> findContour()

Contour Types:
RETR_LINK -> including all outer and inner curves
RETR_EXTERNAL -> include only the outer curves
RETR_TREE -> grandparents,parents,child
RETR_CCOMP ->
